## Lecture

- [Ch1 slides](https://tamucs-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/stchiu_tamu_edu/EX5AsYOTIeJCv0bQtxTiNfUB7c8wSA40jpmOgTCORBBLnw?e=auUpBt)


## Pattern Recognition

1. A pattern is the opposite of randomness.
1. On the other hand, there is "randomness" between two events if they are independent.


> For example, musical preference is independent of the occurrence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning

> Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning have substantial overlap with each other.

- Statistical pattern recognition
- Synthetic pattern recognition
    - on the other hand, it is not statistically reasoning.

## Basic Mathematical Setting

- A vector of measurements
    - $X\in R^d$
    - known as a *feature vector*
    - a target $Y\in R$ to be predicted
- Feature vector
    - $X$
- Target vector
    - $Y$
- The relationship between $X$ and $Y$ (@fig-setting)
    - rarely determinsitic
    - There is no function $f$ such that $Y=f(X)$
    - but express as a joint probability distribution $P_{X,Y}$
- Source of uncertainty
    - Latent factors
        - $Y$ depends on factors that are not available.
    - Measurement noise
        - The values of the predictor $X$ itself

## Prediction

- A predictor
    - $\psi: R^d \to R$
    - $\psi(X) \to Y$
- Predictor ($\psi$) uses information about the joint feature-label distribution $P_{X,Y}$
    - Direct knowledge about $P_{X,Y}$
        - Distribution information
    - Indirect knowlege about $P_{X,Y}$
        - I.I.D. sample $S_n =\{(X_1,Y_1),...,(X_n, Y_n)\}$
            - training dat
            
> The pure data-driven method will ultimately fail.

- Probabilistic method
    - Classical
    - Bayesian method

> Why is not everyone using Bayesian?

Bayesian method is complicated, especially the Bayesian inference.

- Optimal precictor
    - $\psi^{*}(X)$ with complete knowledge of $F_{X,Y}$
- Obstacles
    - Knowlege of $P_{X,Y}$ is unavailable
    - Data-driven prediction rule must rely solely on $S_{n}$
    - Certain data-driven predictors can approach the optimal predictor as $n\to \infty$
    - However, the convergence rate mush be arbitrarily slow in the worst case.
    - *No-free-lunch theorem*
        - for finite $n$, which is the practical case, having knowledge about $F_{X,Y}$ is necessary to guarantee good performance.
