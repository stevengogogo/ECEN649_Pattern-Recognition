## Predicting Stock Market with Bayesian Neural Network

The randomness of the stock market challenge investments to be reliable. Many
approaches have been introduced to find the hidden pattern behind the transitions.
However, error estimation with the non-parametric method is in the early stage.
In this project, we used a Bayesian neural network to predict discrete time-series
data with Takenâ€™s embedding theorem. In this project, The Unadjusted Langevin
Monte Carlo, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) are applied to measure the posterior distribution. We found
that Langevin method performed best for the log likelihood optimization. The
purpose of this project is to provide a model-free approach with uncertainty quantification that is essential to the investment strategy
